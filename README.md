# Pong game written in Python
This is a replica of the arcade game "Pong". The code is inspired from baraltech's tutorial on youtube, but with some slight changes, to make it look and play better.
The changes are:
-How the score system works and where it's placed
-Small changes to the "Ai" opponent
-Added sound effect when the ball hits the paddles
-Added sound effect when either player score a point
